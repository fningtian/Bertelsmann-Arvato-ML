# Customer Segmentation and Acquisition - Bertelsmann Arvato (Jun 2021)

## Machine Learning Engineer Udacity Nanodegree - Capstone Project
This GitHub repository hosts the code and report for "Capstone project - Arvato Customer Segmentation" that I developed and completed as part of Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program. 

In this project, I have employed the use of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to deal with deal with real-life data provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics. More specifically, I have worked on 4 demographics datasets and 2 metadata files provided by Arvato Financial Services with the goal of helping a client mailorder company target next probable customers.

## Requirements
The Jupyter Notebook is written in Python (3.x. version required).

The required libraries for this project are in the [requirement.txt](https://github.com/tian570/Bertelsmann-Arvato-ML/blob/master/requirements.txt) file.

The main packages include: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, lightgbm and xgboost.

## Results
The results have been well docomented in the Jupiter Notebook. Please refer [Arvato Project Workbook.ipynb](https://github.com/tian570/Bertelsmann-Arvato-ML/blob/master/project_notebook/Arvato%20Project%20Workbook.ipynb)

## Acknowldgements
I would like to thank the commitment of Udacity for presenting me to this Capstone project and Arvato Financial Services for providing the real-life data.
